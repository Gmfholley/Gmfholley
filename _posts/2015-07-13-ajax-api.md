Over the weekend, we were given some AJAX atomics to do.  AJAX is not a new language.  It's a different way of using javascript.

- A - Asynchronous
- J - Javascript
- A - And
- X - XML

What that means is that instead of Javascript just manipulating the DOM, we are making calls to the server and receiving information back.

I asked Sumeet why would we ever want to do this? Can't we load the information we need from the server, send any changes back as a post request, and process when they go to a new page?  Here is a non-exhaustive list of some reasons you would want to use AJAX:

- If it's likely the user's experience will be adversely affected by having to reload the page (every page reload typically loses users)
- If the user will likely remain connected to the internet during their time on the page
- If the page contains SO MUCH information that it should be loaded bit by bit so the user doesn't wait 2+ seconds for a page to load (typically, users don't wait for pages to load)
- If the request involves a database change or data point that needs to happen in real time


And it would conversely be bad to use AJAX if:

- the user will lose connectivity while on the page
- changes only make sense if submitted all at once (a new record, for example)

Good to know!

The Atomics just covered the very basics of how that would work.  We're back to using Sinatra, because we have to connect to the server somehow.  There are a few onclick events that make requests to the server with an XMLHttpRequest javascript object.  And then we build a route in Sinatra that returns something to the XMLHttpRequest.

The Atomics did not feel difficult at all.  Sumeet prepared the MVC for us, and we were just adding AJAX on top.  It all made sense.  The water was warm.

"I can do a few laps," I thought, swimming with my eyes closed.

Sumeet had even briefly mentioned that AJAX requests that return objects are sent as JSON, and guess what? Hee!  [I added a `to_json` method to my `database_connector` module so that my models would return JSON.](https://github.com/Gmfholley/07-09-practice-ruby-to-js-project)

Which is why [today's project felt like a plunge into an icy lake.  Here it is](https://github.com/Gmfholley/07-13-API-Project):

>Build a data service API for your school work thus far. (Assignment, User, Link)

>1. Set up a CRUD application
>2. Create a new API controller in Sinatra that returns JSON
>3. Create full CRUD functionality using AJAX

This is Week 7, and we last used Sinatra/Ruby in any big way in Week 4.  It's not that I can't remember, but I have forgotten specifics about how my Menu/controller/database module should be configured.  I am pair programming today with [Cipriana](https://github.com/ciprianna), and her database module works in a completely different way. 

To be honest, with three models (and five tables), I am not sure how *anyone* apart from me would have had time to build all the routes/views they needed in Sinatra.  The only reason I finished is that I only have two views which work for all models.

It has taken us all day today just to get CRUD in Sinatra working.

It's not too hard.  It's not unreasonable.  But it didn't feel like enough time.  Especially since the lesson was supposed to be building the API using AJAX.  We didn't even get close.

I am sure Sumeet knows.  I am sure we will have more time tomorrow.  Today was frustrating, but frustration is a part of programming.

I *was* told this would be hard.

So today is the day to get life advice where we can.  From the movies...
