#Five programming problems

We're working on prep work for Omaha Code School and one of the group members on Slack (our IM + other cool stuff service) shared this article.


[Five programming problems every Software Engineer should be able to solve in less than 1 hour](https://blog.svpino.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour)

Challenge accepted!  I did problem four.  It took me about an hour and ten minutes, but I lost my work about 40 minutes in.  Damn repl.it.  I need to save my work.
