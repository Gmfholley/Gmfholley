Today, we installed the sqlite3 gem.  SQLite (version3) is a lighter, but still robust, SQL database engine, and the sqlite3 gem allows us to use Ruby code to send SQL calls to SQLite.  We can create tables, insert new records and update existing ones, and delete to our hearts' content.

So our assignment was to create a class and add some basic database functionality.  What Sumeet calls the basics of a resource program with CRUD functionality.

CRUD stands for:

 - Create
 - Read
 - Update
 - Destroy

Which I have been thinking of in my head as:

 - Create
 - ~~Remove~~
 - Update
 - ~~Display~~

Why must English have so many synonyms?  But I will attempt to remember.

I really love working with databases.  I like the rules for making normalized tables.  I'm excited to be talking to old friends.  And I'm pleased we'll finally have a place to store all of the data, instead of hard-coded arrays.  This already feels more like a real-world problem than anything we've done so far.

That being said, getting all of the CRUD functionality into a class before the end of the day was hard!  Instead of creating a specific class, I made a module, so this functionality could be extended to any class as a mix-in.
