We are still working on our Project Inventory Manager Database project.  Basically, getting DRY CRUD functionality (I love using double acronyms right in a row like that), I'm trying to use my database connector module for everything.

Here's more of the Technical Specs from Sumeet:

>Every class and method you write should be thoroughly documented. You'll also want to make sure that you're committing frequently writing good messages. And you'll also want to make sure that you're doing a good job of thoughtfully organizing your code.
>
>Your users should be able to navigate your application using a well-formed menu.
>
>Assume that your user will not try to break your code, but also assume that your user will make mistakes. Your program should check for those mistakes as best it can.


But my classes are all different.  And then we have to create a driver, or something, on Command Line to give the user the ability to actually perform CRUD operations for each and every model.

Sumeet coded a really easy example of a driver for a single model using some nested conditionals:

```ruby
  puts "Choose action: (a)dd a student, (c)hange a student's name, as(k) a question, or (q)uit"
  answer = gets.chomp

  while answer != "q" do
    if answer == "a"
      puts "Student's name?"
      name = gets.chomp

      puts "And their age?"
      age = gets.chomp.to_i
    
      student_object = Student.new(nil, name, age)
    
      if student_object.add_to_database
        puts "Student #{student_object.id} added."
      else
        puts "Can't add a student who cannot drink."
      end
    end

    if answer == "c"
    # you get the idea... stuff goes here
    end
  
    if answer == "k"
    # stuff goes here
    end

    puts "Choose action: (a)dd a student, (c)hange a student's name, as(k) a question, or (q)uit"
    answer = gets.chomp
  end
```

Wow.  And this is for one model.  And not all of the CRUD is available.  What about when you have 

 - Models (six of them, three of which the user should be able to change)
    - and then you can perform any CRUD operation on those models, 
      - and then for CRUD operations like Update and Delete, the user can choose which record to Update or Delete
          - and for Update, the user can choose which instance variable to update
          - and for Create, the user should provide values for each and every instance variable
              - some of which might be Foreign Keys, so they should really be selecting from a list of current records


There are, like, five layers of menus here.  My brain is swimming.  And I'm still trying to figure this out.  But what I made in the meantime was a class called Menu.

```ruby
  class Menu
    # menu_itmes - array of menu_items
    # title - String of the title
    attr_reader :menu_items
    attr_accessor :title
    # title - String of the title
    #
    # returns self
    def initialize(title)
      @title = title
      @menu_items = []
    end
    #...
  end
```

And Menu has a variable called `menu_items`, which is an Array of MenuItem objects.

```ruby
  class MenuItem
    attr_reader :key_user_returns, :user_message, :method
  
    def initialize(args)
      @key_user_returns = args[:key_user_returns].to_s
      @user_message = args[:user_message]
      @do_if_chosen = args[:do_if_chosen] #Method to call
    end
  end
```

And MenuItem tells which key the user should pick to select this item, a message of what this MenuItem is, and the method that should be called if this MenuItem is chosen.


So in my driver, I create a bunch of pre-defined menus, of which this is an example:
```ruby
  # defines and runs Main Menu
  #
  # calls the main menu
  def main_menu
      main = Menu.new("What would you like to work on?")
      main.`add_menu_item`({`key_user_returns`: 1, `user_message`: "Work with movies.", `do_if_chosen`:  ["movie_menu"]})
      main.`add_menu_item`({`key_user_returns`: 2, `user_message`: "Work with theatres.", `do_if_chosen`: ["theatre_menu"]})
      main.`add_menu_item`({`key_user_returns`: 3, `user_message`: "Schedule movie time slots by theatre.", `do_if_chosen`: ["loc_time_menu"]})
      main.`add_menu_item`({`key_user_returns`: 4, `user_message`: "Run an analysis on my theatres.", `do_if_chosen`: ["analyze_menu"]})
      `run_menu_and_call_next`(main)
  end
```

And then I run and call my next method, depending upon what they choose.  The `run_menu_and_call_next`(menu) method will use the self.method(`method_name`).call(`parameters_for_method`) ruby methods.  And you can use the Menu objects to keep your code organized.

```ruby
  # runs Menu object and calls next method
  #
  # Menu - Menu object
  #
  # calls next method from user
  def run_menu_and_call_next(menu)
    user_wants = run_menu(menu)
    params = user_wants.slice(1..-1) if user_wants.length > 1
    call_method(user_wants.slice(0), params)
  end
  
  # runs the method name with optional params on this Class's object
  #
  # method_name         - String name of the method in this object to call
  # params (optional)   - String, Integer, Object, or Class of the parameters for the method
  #
  # calls next method
  def call_method(method_name, params=nil)
      if params.nil?
        self.method(method_name).call
      else
        self.method(method_name).call(params)
      end
  end
```

It's not perfect, and I haven't figured out how to get it to create brand-new objects for each model.  Since some instance variables are integer and some are foreign keys and some are strings, I can't figure out how to ask the user to create any new model from scratch.  Those methods are entirely manual. But it's a start!

Note:
I created a video explaining my Menus for this project and beyond.  Find it here:
