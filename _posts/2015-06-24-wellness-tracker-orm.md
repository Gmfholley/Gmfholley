Our newest project was assigned yesterday.  We're going to create another Sinatra project, this time of our own design.  

We're starting from the ground-up.  We need to create our models (which is a fancy way of saying classes that connect to a database).  We need to create our controllers using Sinatra.  And then we need to create our view files.  (For those in the know, those components make up the Model-View-Controller design used by most developers.)

Sumeet has also asked us to organize this week-long project step-by-step by creating milestones and issues in Github for the first time, and getting approval before moving forward.  I like the way we're thrown in but also given plenty of organizational direction for these first steps.  Because right now, I feel like I can design my models, but all the parts after that feel overwhelming.

I am trying to keep it simpler this time.  Having so many tables and foreign keys and SQL joins in my movie manager project nearly killed me.  This all needs to be complete by Friday.

In the video below, I explain the Object Relational Model of my Wellness Tracker.
