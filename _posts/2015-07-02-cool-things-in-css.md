But can I do them?  Oh no.  

Sumeet is starting to talk about specialties - front end vs. back end.  Front end being html, css, javascript, AJAX, the UX.  Back end being what we learned for the first four weeks - ruby, (and soon rails), Sinatra, the Model-View-Controller model.

Back-end felt so comfortable to me, and css so far is so uncomfortable, that it doesn't feel like a real contest.  But I am also trying to remember that I have much more experience in the languages and processes of back-end development, far more than I do in front-end.  And I did, once upon a time, really like designing forms in VBA applications.  Even though they were never very pretty.

So maybe it would be most accurate to say: I want to *want* to like the front-end (too).  So I was excited to hear from our guest speaker, Ryan.  Ryan is a former OCS student who is now a front-end developer for Lemonly.  His work is entirely css and html.  He's only worked there for a short time, but already, he's doing amazing things!

Part of what I liked about the talk was *what's possible*.  Right, on the back-end *what's possible* is so abstract and prosaic it's hard to get excited about.

>You know what you can do with a model?  Wait, wait, wait, you'll never guess...you can *save* a record to the database!  Did you get that?  You can *save* it.  So it never goes away!  Awesome!

You know?  It's hard to get excited about that.  It's the default behavior.  Even if all the methods needed to properly validate and save a record *are* really cool.

But the cool things in the front-end are right on the surface.  They are visually cool.  

- You can create animations *only* using css and svg pictures now.  Here is an example: [source code found here](http://codepen.io/miukimiu/pen/Igouf).

 - You can use parallax (or moving one image on top of another at a different speed) to create the feeling of depth. [Here is an example](http://www.boy-coy.com/#home).

What Ryan is working on right now is this site about Fort Lauderdale...\([now up on Lemonly's site as part of its portfolio](http://lemonly.com/work/young-and-carefree-in-fort-lauderdale-infographic/)\).

The crumbs fall out of the hamburger guy's mouth.  Waves crash in the surfer's sunglasses. Bubbles fizz in the champagne glass of the flapper.  It's a visual feast for the senses.

It is *so cool* that you can do this with code.  I can't do this yet, but I feel inspired!
