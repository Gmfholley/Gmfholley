Again, I'm showing my age.  But do you remember those [TI-80 calculators](http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-TI-80-Graphing-Calculator/dp/B000OMXVA0), back before handheld pcs become a thing that could also make calls?

And you spent 3.5 semesters learning how to derive trigonometry and geometry and most of early calculus entirely by hand?

And suddenly, the math teacher passes out these bad asses and is like, "Ok, now that you know how to do that, we're going to give you these tools.  Use them, because we're going to do awesome stuff now."

And as a student, you were happy.  Because you had passed.  Because you had in your hands the geekiest, most powerful toy *ever*.

But you also felt like, "Daaaamn.  If these existed and you were going to let us use them...Why didn't you give us these before?"

But mostly, you just felt...Hell yeah!

These last few days, we've been given the TI-80 calculators.

Last week...

> Here is ActiveRecord to completely replace SQL and all those validations and manual association methods you were using.

Tuesday this week.

> Here is Rails.  It's like Sinatra, except less flexible.  Oh, also more powerful.  I promise.  Just wait.

Today...

> You know how long you spent creating controllers and routes (RESTful or otherwise) and views and models and database migrations?  Here are two lines that will change your life...

```Mac OSX Command Line
 # Command line
> rails generate scaffold HighScore game:string score:integer  
=> Does all the models, controllers, and views
```

```ruby
 ## config/routes.rb
 resources high_scores
 #Does all the RESTful routes

```

Do you remember that day...July 13th, so just ten days ago...when Sumeet told us to make three models and five tables with basic CRUD, just real quick, so that we could work on an AJAX API?

Yeah, I think that would be possible now. :)
