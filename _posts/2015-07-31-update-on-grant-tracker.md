Today was the last day, when we were supposed to present our projects.  This has been a soft deadline from the first.  Sumeet told us on Monday that in the past, many groups worked on their project over the weekend.

We were also invited (even encouraged) early in the week to think of this project as a two week project if we wanted.  Because often our projects are not in good enough shape in one week for a client.  The rest of this class will be self-guided.   It will be about what we want to work on.

So far our project:

1. Deploys to Heroku
2. Has Basic CRUD operations for our major models
3. Uploads, Edits, and Deletes files
4. Sends emails (in development mode only)
5. Allows user authentication


To do:

1. Make it look prettier.  Because of our problems completing the entire project, Sam is working on a parallel front end.  We need to combine them.
2. Finish up emails in deployment mode
3. Export data to spreadsheet to allow the client to create their own reports
4. Create reports that they know they want now
5. Create search functionality
6. Create settings panel for admin and users
7. Allow creation of many tasks at once (based on a template)


Questions we have:

1. What kind of notes (attached to which models, with what information) do they want?  Are these needed with a complete task management system?
2. Is GoogleDrive sufficient, or do they want some other kind of administration/storage?

I'm really excited about how far we got in a week.  At the same time, by Wednesday, I knew we were being too ambitious.  It's hard to put this all together in a week.

So the team is decided.  We'll be working on it more next week.  ~~[Here is a link to our project, with spec, Documentation with more technical spec, and code itself.](https://github.com/omahacodeschool/grant-tracker)~~

Apparently, this is a private repository.  Boo.  Sorry, I can't share it with you guys.
