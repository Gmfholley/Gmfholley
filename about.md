#Me

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/about.JPG" alt="Welcome!  This is me"></p>

I love books by Octavia Butler, running in the spring, traveling where I've never been, and french press coffee in the morning.

I like like problem solving, abstract thinking, and...I'm lazy.  So code found me.  I have created a lot of non-professional applications in VBA to solve problems. I might share some of them. Now studying ruby.


#Code School
I am currently attending [Omaha Code School](http://omahacodeschool.com/).  It is an intensive 12-week course that teaches novices to become web developers.  This blog will follow my progress through these 12 weeks...and hopefully beyond!

#Company
I work for Farmers National Company, an employee-owned land management firm started in 1929.  We're the premiere land management company in the country, representing land owners in over 25 states.

If you or your family own agricultural land, you should [check us out] (http://farmersnational.com/).
